# Introduction

An Animated API math extension - implementing sine, cosine, tangent and others as AnimatedNodes.

All calculations are implemented based on chained

* Animated.add
* Animated.divide
* Animated.multiply
* Animated.modulo

and representing animation nodes fully compatible with [Native Driver](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2017/02/14/using-native-driver-for-animated) driven animations.

## Installation

Simply add it to your project by calling

`$ react-native add react-native-animated-math`

## Usage

Simple example of using the `AnimatedMath` methods to realize a natively animated circular moving view:

```js
import React from 'react';
import {View, Animated, StyleSheet} from 'react-native';
import AnimatedMath from 'react-native-animated-math';

export default class Rotator extends React.Component {
  state = {
    angle: new Animated.Value(0)
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    this.animate()
  }

  animate(rotation = 1) {
    Animated.timing(this.state.angle, {
      toValue: rotation * 2 * Math.PI,
      duration: 4000,
      useNativeDriver: true
    }).start(() => this.animate(rotation + 1))
  }

  render() {
    let {angle} = this.state,
      radius = 130;

    return (
      <View style={styles.container}>
        <Animated.View style={[styles.dot, {
          transform: [
            {translateX: Animated.multiply(AnimatedMath.sin(angle), radius)},
            {translateY: Animated.multiply(AnimatedMath.cos(angle), -radius)},
          ]
        }]}/>
      </View>
    );
  }
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center'
  },
  dot: {
    position: 'absolute',
    backgroundColor: 'red',
    width: 20,
    height: 20,
    borderRadius: 10,
  }
});
```
